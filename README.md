# **Berudele**

**Berudele** is a GUI tool for converting MySQL databases to SQLite databases and vice versa that developed by [Aref Alikhani](https://github.com/ArefDev). This is a GUI wrapper for the mysql-to-sqlite3 and sqlite3-to-mysql tools developed by [Klemen Tusar](https://github.com/techouse).
# How to Use
Just clone the repository on your local system and run it.

    git clone https://github.com/ArefDev/Berudele.git
    python3 main.py
After running the software, you'll see the following window, which asks you to supply some information for starting the process of transferring tables from a SQLite to MySQL database and vice versa.
